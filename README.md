- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI Provider**: Groq (LLaMA 3.3 70B Versatile)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **PWA**: next-pwa for Progressive Web App functionality
- **Database**: Deno KV for user data and sessions
- **Authentication**: Magic link (passwordless) via Resend
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API for secure API key storage

## Authentication & Security

### How Magic Links Work
1. User enters their email address
2. Server generates a secure one-time token
3. Email with magic link is sent to the user
4. User clicks the link (valid for 15 minutes)
5. Server verifies token and creates a session
6. User is logged in with a secure session cookie

### Security Features
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of authentication and API endpoints
- **Encrypted Storage**: User API keys are encrypted using AES-GCM
- **Secure Sessions**: JWT-based sessions with httpOnly cookies
- **One-Time Tokens**: Magic links expire after 15 minutes and can only be used once
- **CSRF Protection**: Session cookies use SameSite=Lax
- **No Passwords**: Eliminates password-related security risks

### Privacy
- Your data is private and only accessible by you
- API keys are encrypted at rest
- You can delete your account and all data at any time
- The app works fully anonymously if you choose not to sign in
